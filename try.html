            It's that time of year again where we all say "New Year new me".
            We head to the gym, go all out, we are completely exhausted by the end of the
            first day, but we feel good because we made a plan and we did something.
            The next day we wake up, we can barely move and every single part of our bodies
            hurt and we barely want to get out of the bed. BUT we made a commitment so we go to
            the gym the next day and do the exact same thing. At the end of the week we are
            hate the gym, we hate working out, we hate our bodies, we hate everything,
            and we never want to go back to the gym again.        <br><br>
            Slowly but surely, we begin to lose motivation and instead of going to the gym
            daily, we go a couple of times a week, then we go about once a week, then we
            start making excuses as to why we can't go to the gym, and then we stop going
            altogether.
            <br><br>
            Anywhere between 80-90% of people who join a gym in January will completely
            quit within 3 months. You may have done this in the past, or you may be on
            that exact path now. Doing the same thing will not give you different results,
            so let's simplify the process, and make sure that you're not burnt out
            after your first day so you can actually enjoy the process of getting fit and not
            feel like you're torturing yourself. Click below to get started!
